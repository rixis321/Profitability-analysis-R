Topic: In a metalworking company, 25 customers were randomly selected in 1994 and in 1995 and the level of profitability of sales of the company's products to those recipients was examined.

Tasks:

Analyze the structure of profitability in 1994 and 1995 by determining the measures of location, differentiation, asymmetry, and clustering (based on the calculated values, make short characteristics of the tests). Make histograms of empirical distributions (by building the appropriate distribution series first).

Check whether the yields are normally distributed (Kolmogorov test with significance level α = 0.05).

Estimate by interval (confidence factor 1 - α = 0.98) the average profitability of companies. Calculate the relative precision of the estimate and verify whether we have the foundations to generalize the resulting confidence interval to the entire population profitability of metal industry companies in 1994.

Estimate by interval (confidence factor 1 - α = 0.98) the variance of the companies in the industry in 1995. Calculate the relative precision of the estimate and verify whether we have the foundations for generalizing the obtained confidence interval to the entire profitability population of metal industry companies in 1995.

Can it be assumed that the company's average profitability improved in 1995 compared to 1994? (formulate and verify the appropriate hypothesis with significance level α = 0.05)
